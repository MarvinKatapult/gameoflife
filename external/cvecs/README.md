# The Idea
Everyone should have dynamic Arrays in C.

# Getting Started
You can compile the example with __./build.sh__
The Documentation is the Header.

# Current Implementations
- Vec    - Generic dynamic Array
- StrVec - String dynamic Array (With or without custom string implementation)
- IntVec - Integer dynamic Array
